## Air-Fare-Revenue-Management  

**OBJECTIVE** 

The Airfare Price Movement Analyzer is a GitHub project designed to systematically monitor and analyze the movement of airfare prices based on the proximity of the observation date to the departure date. The primary goal of this project is to provide users with insights into the fluctuations, trends, and oscillations in airfare prices, enabling them to make informed decisions when planning their travels.

**CONTRIBUTIONS**

Contributions to this project are welcomed, including but not limited to code improvements, additional features, and integration with new data sources. The collaborative nature of this project aims to create a valuable tool for travelers seeking to navigate the complexities of airfare pricing.

**A BRIEF INTRODUCTION TO REVENUE MANAGEMENT**  

In 1978 the Airline Deregulation Act loosened the control of airline prices, which had previously
been strictly regulated based on standardized price and profitability targets. The passage of this act led to a
rapid change and rash of innovation in the industry. Established carriers were now free to change prices
and schedules all without approval.  

A new type of carrier began to emerge with lower costs, simpler operations, and no-frills service. These new
low-cost carriers (LCC) were able to tap into a new and vast market of people (leisure/discretionary travel)
and this turned out to be quite profitable.  

These discretionary travelers were much more price sensitive than their business counterparts so
established carriers saw these customers leave for LCCs in droves. They knew they could not compete on
cost alone because their operating costs were too high and if they matched the prices of the low-cost
carriers they would quickly be ruined. A new strategy was needed - what would become known as
revenue/yield management.  

American Airlines pioneered this strategy by recognizing that the marginal cost of "producing" another seat
was near 0 because the cost of the flight (staff, fuel, etc.) was fixed. As a result, they were able to compete
on cost using their "surplus" seats. They created product segmentation by setting up rules for purchase
restrictions (e.g. prices that would only be available 30 days before departure for nonrefundable tickets
which required a 7 day stay) and limited the number of these discount seats which could be sold to prevent
business travelers from utilizing these low fares.  

The idea that the same physical product (a single seat on a flight) would cost different amounts seems
normal to us now - but it was revolutionary at the time. By pioneering this strategy of yield management,
American Airlines was not only able to survive but thrive - competing so effectively with low-cost carriers,
even at a much higher operating cost, that many went bankrupt. American Airlines estimated that RM
practices generated $1.4B additional revenue over a 3-year period in 1988.
